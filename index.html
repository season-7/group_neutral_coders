                <h2>Status of the Labor Market</h2>
                
                <p>Unemployment and underemployment is currently at 40 per cent of the labor force (World Fact Book,2008)  estimated  at  about  20  million  people.  Unemployment  for  age  15-34  years,  standing  at  25  per cent in 2005/06 and has increased over the years. The largest rise in the working-age population was recorded among the age cohort of 15-34 years where the working -age population increased from 9.7 million persons in 1998/99 to 13.1 million persons in 2005/2006.The overall labour force participation rate  was slightly over 72 percent  in 2005/2006 with the  male labour force  participation being higher than  the  female  participation  rate.  The  participation  rates  were  higher  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas.The  unemployment  rate  among  females  in  2005/06  was  14.3  per  cent  compared  to  11.2  per  cent among  males  (KNBS,  2008). A  higher  proportion  of  the  labour  force  (77.5  per cent)  is  found  in  the rural areas where employment opportunities are minimal, leading to rural-urban migration.</p>
                
                <p>Data from the government’s annual economic surveys show that formal sector employment growth has been on the increase but at a very slow rate. In 2009,the public sector created 2 million jobs and 2.127 million jobs in 2011. On the other hand, informal sector employment increased by 10 per cent between 1998 and 2002, 6.4  per cent  between 2002 and 2005, and 12.3  per cent  between 2006 and 2008.This  was  attributed  to  minimal  growth  in  both  public  and  modern  sector  employment,  which forced many young people into the informal sector. The fact that only 1.5 per cent of the unemployed youth  have  formal  education  beyond  the  secondary  school  level  and  over  92  per cent  have  no vocational  or  professional  skills  training  worsens  the  situation  and  limits  their  chances  of  fully participating in the formal sector. Hence, even though the earnings received in the informal sector are inadequate to put people above the poverty line, the ‘working poor’ cannot afford not to be engaged in some activity.</p>
                
                <p>The employment challenge is further compounded by the casualization of jobs, where the proportion of  casual  workers  in  wage  employment  increased  gradually  from  17.9  per  cent  in  2000  to  30.1  per cent in 2010.  These workers, like those in the informal sector do not enjoy the fundamental rights at work,  such  as  freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining;  right  to  paid  leave;  and  the  right  to social  protection,  as  provided  under  the  National  Social  Security  Fund  and  the  National  Hospital Insurance  Fund. Small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  provide  employment  opportunities  for  74  per cent of the total employed. However, the ability of the MSE sector to create both quality and durable jobs   is   hampered   by   numerous   challenges   and   constraints   including   an   unfavorable   policy environment,  inhibitive  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  limited  access  to  financial  services  and markets,   inadequate   access   to   skills   and   technology,   insecurity   of   tenure,   poor   access   to infrastructure,  inadequate  business  skills  and  linkages  with  large enterprises,  gender    inequality, unfavorable taxation regime, limited access to information, HIV and AIDS pandemic and occupational health and safety requirements.</p>

                <h2>Why Plea for Decent work</h2>
                
                <p>Decent work enables households to break the cycle of poverty by improving access to income, social security, education and health. In 2009,848 million workers in developing regions were living below the poverty line of US$ 1.25 a day – a 215 million increase from 2008 when the total number of “working poor” was 633 million.</p>
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
            
                <p>As a matter of opinion, economic growth is greatly fostered whenever employment opportunities are equitably distributed across a nation's population</p>
                <p>A key target to the achievement of sustainable economic growth is to promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services</p>
                <p>Perhaps the major question would be how to create decent jobs in this digital age. Over the years, start-ups are massively springing forth across our nation. However, the question has been widely overlooked is whether or not start-up actually create lots of goods jobs.</p>
                <p>Not all jobs are created equal. And as far as we know, jobs created by startups – at least the newly-formed-firm variety – are less equal, in two ways. One is that they pay less: A study in the UK has shown that on the average, a startup reaches only $180,000 in <a href="http://www.scaleupreport.org/scaleup-report.pdf">revenues</a> after its sixth year, barely enough to pay salaries. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292115001865?np=y">recent study</a> in Denmark has found that indeed, startups create quite a few jobs, but that a disproportionate number of them are low-skilled service jobs.</p>
                <p>For developed and developing nations alike, it is clear that as globalization gathers pace, adding more supply chains operating in more complex regulatory environments with blurred geographic boundaries, no country can ignore the digital world without getting left out of the world economy.</p>
                <p>So how can we keep the human dimension — in a world of work run more and more by robots? How can we best adapt the labour market and create decent jobs?</p>
                <p>Fundamentally and critically, we need to anticipate upcoming technological changes and tackle the education and skills mismatch in labour markets. Globally, one third of employers surveyed complain of not being able to find the right skill sets to fill existing vacancies.</p>
                <p>We must build solid <a href="images/Guy-Rider.png">bridges</a> between the world of work and training providers, so that skills can be matched to market needs. This is not only a matter for public policy. Employers and trade unions must take more responsibility for investing in skills by sitting at the table with trainers and policy makers. Their talks must be informed by labour market information, employment services and performance reviews.</p>
                <p>Adequate education and skills for countries at all development levels increases their ability to innovate and adopt new technologies. It means the difference between inclusive growth and growth that leaves large segments of society behind. A workforce that has been appropriately trained and is able to continue learning boosts investor confidence and thus job growth</p>
